    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cinnamon rolls are a sweet pastry commonly served in Northern Europe and North America. They are made by rolling a sheet of yeast-leavened dough with a cinnamon-sugar mixture.<br> The dough is then cut into individual portions and baked in a pan. Once baked, the rolls are topped with a sweet glaze or frosting.<br> Cinnamon rolls are often enjoyed for breakfast or as a dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For the dough:</li>
      <li>1 cup warm milk (110°F)</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>For the filling:</li>
      <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>For the cream cheese frosting:</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cup cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm milk and let it sit for 5 minutes until foamy.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the sugar, butter, eggs, and salt. Add the flour and mix until a soft dough forms.</li>
      <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter over the dough and sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture on top.</li>
      <li>Roll up the dough tightly and cut it into 12 equal pieces. Place the rolls in a greased 9x13-inch baking pan, cover, and let them rise for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>Bake the rolls in a preheated 400°F oven for 15-20 minutes until golden brown.</li>
      <li>While the rolls are baking, prepare the cream cheese frosting by beating together the butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar, vanilla, and salt until smooth.</li>
      <li>Spread the frosting over the warm cinnamon rolls and serve.</li>
